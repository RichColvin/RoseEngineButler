######################## RS274NGC_STARTUP_CODE #######################
# A string of NC codes that the interpreter is initialized with. This is 
# not a substitute for specifying modal G-codes at the top of each NGC 
# file, because the modal codes of machines differ, and may be changed
# by G-code interpreted earlier in the session.
#
# Units to use -------------------------------------------------------
# G20 - use inches for length units.
# G21 - use millimeters for length units.
#
# Cutter compensation ------------------------------------------------
# G40 - turn cutter compensation off.
# G41 <D-> (left of programmed path)
# G42 <D-> (right of programmed path)
#
# Distance mode -------------------------------------------------------
# G90 - absolute distance mode In absolute distance mode, axis numbers
#    (X, Y, Z, A, B, C, U, V, W) usually represent positions in terms
#    of the currently active coordinate system. Any exceptions to that
#    rule are described explicitly in the G80 G89 section.
# G91 - incremental distance mode In incremental distance mode, axis
#    numbers usually represent increments from the current coordinate.
#
# Feed rate mode ------------------------------------------------------
# G93 - is Inverse Time Mode. In inverse time feed rate mode, an F word
#    means the move should be completed in [one divided by the F
#    number] minutes. For example, if the F number is 2.0, the move
#    should be completed in half a minute.
#    When the inverse time feed rate mode is active, an F word must
#    appear on every line which has a G1, G2, or G3 motion, and an
#    F-word on a line that does not have G1, G2, or G3 is ignored. 
#    Being in inverse time feed rate mode does not affect G0 (rapid
#    move) motions.
# G94 - is Units per Minute Mode. In units per minute feed mode, an F
#    word is interpreted to mean the controlled point should move at a
#    certain number of inches per minute, millimeters per minute, or
#    degrees per minute, depending upon what length units are being
#    used and which axis or axes are moving.
# G95 - is Units per Revolution Mode In units per revolution mode, an
#    F-word is interpreted to mean the controlled point should move a
#    certain number of inches per revolution of the spindle, depending
#    on what length units are being used and which axis or axes are
#    moving. G95 is not suitable for threading, for threading use G33
#    or G76. G95 requires that spindle.N.speed-in to be connected. The
#    actual spindle to which the feed is synchronised is chosen by the
#    $ parameter.
#
# Spindle control mode ------------------------------------------------
# G96 <D-> S- <$-> (Constant Surface Speed Mode)
# G97 S- <$-> (RPM Mode)
#
# G64 Path Blending ---------------------------------------------------
# G64 <P- <Q->>
#    P - motion blending tolerance
#    Q - naive cam tolerance

# The default behavior is for LinuxCNC to force the user to home the
